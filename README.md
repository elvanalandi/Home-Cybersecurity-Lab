## Home Cybersecurity Lab
  
This is a collection of projects I’ve built to learn how to protect my home network. I’ve tried out different tools like firewalls, security monitoring systems, and threat detection platforms. Each project includes easy-to-follow steps showing what I did and what I learned along the way.  
  
<h3>🔥 OPNsense Firewall</h3>  
<p>Set up and configured OPNsense, a powerful open-source firewall, to protect my home network from unauthorized access and malicious traffic.</p>

  </li>
</ul>
  
<h3>🛡️ Wazuh SIEM</h3>
<p>A range of hands-on projects using Wazuh to monitor and protect systems in a home lab environment.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="/Wazuh/Wazuh%20SSH%20Brute%20Force%20Attack%20Protection"><strong>SSH Brute Force Attack Protection</strong></a>: Set up Wazuh to detect and automatically block brute force attempts.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="/Wazuh/Wazuh%20Integration%20with%20TheHive"><strong>Integration with TheHive</strong></a>: Connected Wazuh with TheHive to enhance incident response.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="/Wazuh/Wazuh%20Integration%20with%20Suricata"><strong>Integration with Suricata</strong></a>: Linked Wazuh with Suricata IDS for better threat detection and correlation.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>🧠 Incident Response Platform (TheHive, Cortex, MISP)</h3>
<p>Built a complete open-source incident response stack to analyze and manage threats.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="/TheHive-Cortex-MISP/TheHive-Cortex-MISP%20Setup%20and%20Integration"><strong>Setup and Integration</strong></a>: Installed and configured TheHive, Cortex, and MISP to streamline threat intel and automate response workflows.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>📊 Splunk</h3>
<p>Used Splunk Enterprise for threat analysis and visualization.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="/Splunk/DNS%20Spoofing%20Analysis"><strong>DNS Spoofing Analysis</strong></a>: Investigated a simulated DNS spoofing attack using Splunk dashboards and queries.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>🌐 Suricata IDS/IPS</h3>
<p>Deployed Suricata to detect suspicious activity in network traffic.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="/Suricata/Suricata%20Installation%20and%20Configuration"><strong>Installation and Configuration</strong></a>: Set up Suricata with rule tuning and log forwarding for better visibility and control.
  </li>
</ul>  

<h3>🛡️ Active Directory Monitoring with Grafana</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="/Grafana/Tools%20Installation%20and%20Configuration"><strong>Installation of Windows Exporter, Prometheus, and Grafana</strong></a>: Installed Windows Exporter (formerly WMI Exporter) on domain controllers to expose key AD metrics such as CPU usage and system uptime. Configured Prometheus to collect these metrics at regular intervals and set up Grafana dashboards for real-time visibility and alerting.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="/Grafana/Setting%20Up%20Prometheus%20Data%20Source"><strong>Setting Up Prometheus Data Source in Grafana</strong></a>: Connected Prometheus to Grafana by configuring it as a data source.
  </li>
</ul>
