## Home Cybersecurity Lab
  
This is a collection of projects I‚Äôve built to learn how to protect my home network. I‚Äôve tried out different tools like firewalls, security monitoring systems, and threat detection platforms. Each project includes easy-to-follow steps showing what I did and what I learned along the way.
