## Project Overview
This project offers a step-by-step guide for installing and integrating TheHive with Cortex and MISP, creating a comprehensive and automated incident response investigation platform.
## Documentation
There are two ways to install these three applications. The first method is to download the packages individually, as outlined in this [web page](https://medium.com/@hasithaupekshitha97/simplifying-security-operations-installing-wazuh-the-hive-cortex-and-misp-using-docker-01fc4229eb73), which I am using as a reference. This guide also includes instructions for installing Wazuh.<br />

The second method is to create a **docker-compose** file that includes configuration settings for all the applications. I will demonstrate this approach in this project as it is very convenient.
The .yaml file can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/ls111-cybersec/thehive-cortex-misp-docker-compose-lab11update/blob/main/docker-compose.yml). I updated the Elasticsearch version to 7.17.12 and adjusted the ports to align with the Wazuh port configuration.

After creating the **docker-compose** file, you can start the Docker containers using the **docker-compose up** command. This will deploy and launch the containers for TheHive, Cortex, and MISP.<br />
The `-d` flag will run the containers in the background, allowing you to continue using your terminal.<br />

This process may take some time to complete. However, you can check if the services are running by using the **docker-compose ps** command, as shown in the image below.<br />
