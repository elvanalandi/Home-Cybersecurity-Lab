### Overview
This project demonstrates how to integrate Threat Intelligence platform like VirusTotal and AbuseIPDB with Splunk SOAR to enrich Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and enhance automated threat analysis and response capabilities.  

### Requirements
- A running and accessible instance of **Splunk SOAR**

### VirusTotal Integration Steps
1. **Navigate to the [VirusTotal App on Splunkbase](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5865)**  
   Go to the Splunkbase website and search for *VirusTotal App*.

2. **Download the App and Verify Its Integrity**  
   After downloading the file, copy the verification command provided on the Splunkbase page to validate the file's integrity.  
   - If you're using **Linux**, use the SHA256 command provided.

   - If you're using **Windows**, run the `Get-FileHash` command in PowerShell and compare the resulting hash with the one shown on the Splunkbase.

3. **Access the Apps Dashboard**  
   In the Splunk SOAR interface, navigate to the top-left menu and select **Automation** > **Apps**. Then, click **Install App** from the top-right corner.

5. **Retrieve Your VirusTotal API Key**  
   Visit the [VirusTotal website](https://www.virustotal.com/), and log in to your account. If you don't have one yet, sign up first for free.  
   Once logged in, go to your **Account** menu, select **API Key**. Copy the key and store it in a temporary location (you'll need it later).

6. **Return to the Apps Dashboard in Splunk SOAR**
   You should now see that the VirusTotal app has been successfully installed.  
   To establish a connection between **Splunk SOAR** and **VirusTotal**, click **Configure New Asset**.

7. **Configure VirusTotal**  
   In the **Asset Info** section, fill in the **Asset Name**, **Product Vendor**, **Product Name**, and any relevant **Tags**.

   ![VirusTotal Access Control](images/virustotal-access-control.png)  
   Finally, save the configuration and test the connection. You can test connectivity in the **Asset Settings** by clicking **Test Connectivity**.

### AbuseIPDB Integration Steps  
For the AbuseIPDB integration, we’ll use a different approach to install the application directly from within Splunk SOAR.  
1. **Navigate to the Apps Dashboard**  
   On the right-hand side of the Apps page, click **New Apps**. This feature allows you to automatically search for and install available apps directly within Splunk SOAR.  
   ![New Apps](images/new-apps.png)  
2. **Install AbuseIPDB**
   In the search bar, type **AbuseIPDB** and click **Install** when it appears in the list.  
   ![Install AbuseIPDB](images/install-abuseipdb.png)  
   A login popup will appear. Sign in with your Splunk credentials.  
   - If you don’t have an account yet, create one at the [Splunk Sign-Up page](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/form/sign-up.html).  
   - Accept the terms and conditions, then proceed by clicking **Login and Install**.

3. **Configure AbuseIPDB**
   After installation, click **Configure New Asset** to begin setting up the integration.  
   ![AbuseIPDB App](images/abuseipdb-app.png)  
   In the **Asset Info** section, fill in the **Asset Name**, **Product Vendor**, **Product Name**, and any relevant **Tags**.  
   ![AbuseIPDB Asset Info](images/abuseipdb-asset-info.png)  
   Next, create an account on the [AbuseIPDB Website](https://www.abuseipdb.com).  
   - After signing in, navigate to **User Account** > **API**, then click **Create Key** under the **Create API Key** section.  
   ![Create AbuseIPDB API Key](images/abuseipdb-create-api-key.png)  
   - Enter a name for your API key and click **Create**.  
   ![AbuseIPDB API Key Name](images/abuseipdb-api-key-name.png)  
   - Copy the generated API key.  
   ![AbuseIPDB API Key](images/abuseipdb-api-key.png)  
   Return to Splunk SOAR and paste the API key into the **API Key** field. Select the user account that will run automated actions.  
   ![AbuseIPDB Asset Settings](images/abuseipdb-asset-settings.png)  
   Configure **Approval Settings** and **Access Control**similarly to how it was done for the VirusTotal integration.  
   Lastly, test the connectivity.  A successful connection will display a message similar to the image below.
