### Overview
This project demonstrates how to develop a phishing playbook in Splunk SOAR to automate phishing response and escalation.  

### Requirements
- A running and accessible instance of **Splunk SOAR**
- A Gmail account for the analyst
- A Gmail account to be monitored

### Phishing Playbook Implementation Walkthrough
1. **Create Playbook**  
   Navigate to the SOAR **Playbooks** dashboard and click the **+ Playbook** button on the right-hand side.   
   ![Playbooks Dashboard](images/playbook-dashboard.png)  
   Select **Automation** as the **Playbook Type**  
   ![Playbook Type](images/playbook-type.png)  
2. **IMAP Block**  
   Begin by adding an **Action** block and selecting the **get email** function from **IMAP**.  
   ![IMAP Block](images/imap-block.png)  
   Rename the block to **List Emails** and edit the code using the Python editor on the right-hand side.  
   Specify the following parameters:
   ```
   "folder": "inbox",
   "container_id": container.get("id"),
   "search_filter": "UNSEEN",
   "ingest_email": True
   ```

3. **Create Custom Functions**  
   Custom functions are used in the playbook to support email analysis and IOC (Indicators of Compromise) extraction.  
   Go to the **Custom Functions** menu and click on the **+ Custom Function** button.  
   ![Create Custom Functions](images/create-custom-functions.png)
   In this project, I will create two custom functions â€” one for extracting IOCs from the email, and another for performing a full analysis of the email.  
   The **extract_email_iocs** function combines the email header and body, and uses regex to extract patterns such as URLs, IP addresses, and email addresses.  
   [Extract Email IOCs Custom Function](extract_email_iocs.txt)  
   The **vt_abuse_ipdb_email_analysis** function analyses the email using data from the headers, email body, VirusTotal results, and AbuseIPDB scores.
   - It extracts the sender's email address from the `From` header.
   - It checks for suspicious keywords in the email body.
   - It reviews VirusTotal URL analysis results and generates a summary message if any are flagged as malicious.
   - It analyses any attached files using VirusTotal file reputation and summarizes the results.
   - It evaluates AbuseIPDB results, flagging IPs with an abuseConfidenceScore >= 50.
   - Finally, it builds a verdict(`malicious` or `benign`) and a reason based on all the findings.

4. **Extract Email IOCs Utility Block**  
   Next, add a Utility Block using the **extract_email_iocs** function. Map the headers to the **List Email** data and the body to the **CEF artifact** `bodyPart1` field.  
   ![Extract Email IOCs Function](images/extract-email-iocs-function.png)  
5. **IP Decision Block**   
   This Decision Block checks whether the email contains any IP addresses to analyse. If the result from the extraction is **not empty**, the playbook proceeds with IP analysis using AbuseIPDB.  
   ![IP Decision Block](images/ip-decision.png)  
6. **Check IPs in AbuseIPDB Action Block**  
   Add an Action Block using the **lookup ip** action from the **AbuseIPDB** app. I added some custom code to support handling both single IP and a list of IPs.  
   ![Check IP in AbuseIPDB Action Block](images/abuseipdb-block.png)  
7. **URL Decision Block**  
   This block checks if at least one URL was detected in the email. If a URL is found, it proceeds to URL analysis. I unchecked the **Join settings** on the `check_ips_in_abuseipdb` block so that the playbook continues even if no IPs are detected.  
   ![URL Decision Block](images/url-decision.png)  
8. **Check URLs in VirusTotal Action Block**  
   Add an Action Block using the **url reputation** action from the **VirusTotal** app. Similar to the AbuseIPDB action block, I included custom code to support both a single URL and a list of URLs.  
   ![Check URLs in VirusTotal Action Block](images/url-check-vt-block.png)  
9. **FileHash Decision Block**  
   This block checks whether the `fileHash`, `fileName`, or `vaultId` is not empty (i.e., not **None**). If any of them is present, the workflow proceeds to check the file attachment using VirusTotal.  
   ![File Hash Decision Block](images/filehash-decision.png)  
10. **Check File Attachments in VirusTotal Action Block**  
    Add an Action Block using the **file reputation** action from the **VirusTotal** app to scan the file attachment.  
    ![Check File Attachments in VirusTotal Action Block](images/file-check-vt-block.png)  
11. **Email Analysis Utility Block**  
    This is the main component of this playbook. The email analysis function we created earlier will be applied here. I mapped the headers from IMAP, results from AbuseIPDB and VirusTotal, and the email body from the artifact as inputs to the function.  
    ![Email Analysis Function](images/email-analysis-function.png)  
12. **Verdict Decision Block**  
    Based on the result from the email analysis function, if the verdict is **malicious**, the playbook automatically proceeds to notify the analyst.  
    ![Verdict Decision Block](images/verdict-decision.png)  
13. **Email Analyst Action Block**  
    Using the SMTP app, specify the analyst's Gmail account and configure the subject and body of the email. I created a custom email body to deliver a comprehensive and informative summary, allowing the analyst to quickly escalate the issue. All details are sourced from the analysis results.  
    ![Email Notification](images/email-notification.png)  
    The email body includes a summary of results from VirusTotal and AbuseIPDB, the sender's email, raw message content, the final verdict, and the reasoning.  
    ![Email Notification Body](images/email-notification-body.png)  
    The images below show examples of the email alert sent to the analyst.  
    ![Email Alert Example](images/email-alert-1.png)  
    ![Email Alert Example Cont](images/email-alert-2.png)  
    The email message is intentionally designed to trigger detection alerts (not a real phishing email).
